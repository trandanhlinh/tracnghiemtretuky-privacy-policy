  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: July 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile application <strong>"Autism Screening Quiz"</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). This App is developed to assist parents and caregivers in conducting early screening assessments for signs of autism spectrum disorder in children.</p>

  <h2>1. No Internet Connection Required</h2>
  <p>The App operates entirely offline. It does not require or establish an internet connection at any time. All functionality is available without access to the internet.</p>

  <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage data. The App does not include any analytics, trackers, or advertising SDKs.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All user input and test results are stored locally on the user's device. This data is never transmitted to external servers and remains private unless the user manually exports or shares it.</p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does not use any third-party services or SDKs that might collect data or track user behavior.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since the App operates fully offline and stores data only on the local device, there is no risk of data interception during transmission. However, users are responsible for protecting their device and data (e.g., by using device passcodes or biometrics).</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is intended to be used by adults (e.g., parents, guardians, caregivers) to assess children. It is not designed for use by children under 13 without adult supervision. No information about children is collected, processed, or stored externally.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If any changes are made to this privacy policy, the updated version will be included in a future release of the App.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:</p>
  <p><em>your_email@example.com</em></p>

  <p>By using this App, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
